1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
 Find a man, let's hear the financial

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:07,599
 paper, the behavior of people as they interact with one another in markets.

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,640
 Fires and sellers interact with each other in markets.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:18,519
 And the buyers and sellers that interact with each other are eventually going to determine

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,719
 what actually is sold.

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:30,000
 The price that he has sold and how much is it so.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Mark.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 It's an easy part. [inaudible]

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 [inaudible]

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 [inaudible] I need to see that all the things. Can you say something like this?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 [LAUGHTER]

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Hey.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Hey.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I wish I had you.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I really don't know.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,760
 I think all the time. (indistinct)

22
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,099
 (indistinct) - Thanks far.

23
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:39,939
 Bias.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,739
 As you might expect,

25
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:42,579
 instead of walking aside,

26
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:43,900
 but not producing any news,

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,000
 biogenes and determined demands. And then sellers are going to argue As you might expect, it's the general sign that I'm producing anything new. Why is it in the determined demand?

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And then sellers are going to

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 all will please then determine supply.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Now we're going to do it quickly.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 We're going to have graph A and graph B. And this is going to be a demand graph.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And this is going to be a supply graph.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 What we are going to focus on when we focus on supply and demand is this graph.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,280
 Together. together. However, what we're focusing on first is we're going to break any steps.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,159
 We're going to focus on demand first, then we're going to focus on supply,

36
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,400
 and then we're going to work together, talk about how they interact together.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,919
 But first step, second step, third step.

38
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:44,639
 We will need to know how this graph goes from here to a point there.

39
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:53,000
 We're all going to need to know how this graph demand goes to there, and you guys get up to do this.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And this graph goes to there, there, there.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Okay.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,300
 Mind the light coming. But right now, we'll put the thing on this banana. That's not a big one to buy and they'll bring it together.

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,500
 Okay, what is the market then?

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,900
 A competitive market.

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,300
 It makes the market in which there are many buyers and sellers.

46
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,800
 Market is where there are many buyers and sellers.

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,099
 So each has a negligible impact on the market price.

48
00:03:24,099 --> 00:04:05,000
 And then we can know what being supposed to be insignificant. Okay. That's the market definition definition so on and so forth.

49
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,599
 Now let's get to what exactly is the main,

50
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,639
 how do we use the finance, how do they move,

51
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,280
 what exactly is this so on and so on and so on.

52
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:52,000
 Let's see, come on. (clears throat) I'm sure she understood you're right nice for what movies

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 They model them after you.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 You were above. [laughter]

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 [laughter]

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 [laughter]

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It's not about fail.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 It's not about a little bit of shit.

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 It's about the past failed. It's not about it. It will be a shit. There's no ask-tense thing about it.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 What about the future?

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I think that would be bad.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Thank you.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I'm wearing a little bit bigger.

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I'm wearing a little bit bigger.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Have you ever signed down on the third?

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,439
 All I have to do is just flex a little bit.

67
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,899
 - I'm interested in your regard. (indistinct)

68
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,379
 - Let me live in Hylolomand.

69
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,839
 Yeah, this is my problem.

70
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,160
 - Okay, Doming, here's where it's gonna get

71
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,000
 a little bit confusing to some of you.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 This says quantity demanded.

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Quantity demanded are two different day.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 About us.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Okay.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Okay.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 How about that? - Okay, quantity demanded is the following.

78
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,839
 It's simply the amount of the virus going to the world

79
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,839
 of purchase, that's it, please simple.

80
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,360
 It's really simple, quantity demanded is actually

81
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,779
 I'm good, the virus willing to enable your purchase.

82
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:10,779
 If you want to purchase 15 bottles of protein shakes

83
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,180
 before you get to the gym,

84
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,019
 - Yes.

85
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:13,860
 - Go buy them.

86
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,699
 - A lot of things.

87
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:15,540
 - That is a sign.

88
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,980
 - What I buy about a week, man.

89
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:21,620
 - Thank you.

90
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,980
 - The gym will burn before.

91
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,000
 - They have to like kick other people out.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 They don't get too soft.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Just very much.

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 They reserve.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 You have to call that.

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 You should.

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And then they like everyone.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,480
 They're like taking notes soon. 20 minutes.

99
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,480
 Now the law of demand is following.

100
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,319
 The law of demand states.

101
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,240
 Now this is where a lot of students are going to be getting to get to the president for

102
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,079
 the next couple minutes or a couple weeks rather.

103
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,120
 So I'm going to get off this for a moment, okay?

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,600
 It states that all are illegal and in economic terms there's a lack of order that we use in economics

105
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
 of called setter as parents.

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,000
 Setter as parents, and I'm gonna get off this screen for a moment,

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 so I'm gonna go back, because I'm gonna talk about setter as parents.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Setter as parents simply mean that all other things are equal,

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
 then so it's gonna happen.

110
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,000
 Now, what you guys are gonna do is you guys are gonna sit there

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 and you're gonna see economics term, I told you,

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,480
 I'm gonna get off this screen for a moment. You guys are gonna see economics term you guys are going to sit there and you're going to see economics term. I told you I'm going to get off the screen for a moment. You guys are going to see economics

113
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,560
 term and you're going to sit and you're going to analyze it too much. You're going to have paralysis.

114
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,840
 You're going to say well this is a photo, well this is going to happen right and then this is

115
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,759
 going to happen and what it is that's not going to matter to you. Not going to warn you right now.

116
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,519
 You're going to have to be very careful in that mindset and economics. Economics assumes

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,639
 that the first alternative is the answer,

118
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,159
 not the second alternative, but the third alternative,

119
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,720
 or the what is the alternative.

120
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,200
 And the example I give all the time is I

121
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,679
 ask you guys to come to front and the question is,

122
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,480
 is what color is this guy?

123
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,039
 What?

124
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:04,679
 So if I gave everyone a test question,

125
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,919
 so what color is the sky?

126
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,840
 I think that all of you have red blue.

127
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,360
 Here's the one, so what if it's black?

128
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,840
 The blue.

129
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,679
 What if it's night?

130
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,679
 The silver blue?

131
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,919
 What if it's very cloudy?

132
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,799
 It's a silver blue, it's a little bright.

133
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,320
 It's very, um, cloudy. It's a sublucous or a little bright.

134
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,159
 Well, I'm excited about the progression.

135
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,679
 Well, great, right?

136
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,799
 You see how I can say the what if, what if, what if, what if, what if,

137
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,840
 just because I say what if it doesn't disprove you with both,

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,440
 that the sky is generally considered blue.

139
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,840
 An economics income to that track.

140
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:50,000
 You're going to say, oh,, well, there's been some increases. But the person gets laid off. The one of the first

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
 accounts on board is what is this out? That's not the economic, from how economics

142
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,279
 functions. Economics, as the word, is setters, parabas, being at all in it. People are not

143
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,039
 talking about any of the what is the size of the law demand state is that

144
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,559
 for all other things people and we're not playing a lot of games, we're not playing

145
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:17,519
 all these other variables. The quantity demanded of a good is going to fall with the price of

146
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,600
 that good prices. I will see what the market is, the price increases their um, coffee,

147
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,480
 What market is voice increases their copy by one more dollar on the top going market choice and buying it for one more dollar

148
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,799
 As the price increases, quantity demanded is going to be there

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,879
 Pretty simple we can buy less things at the market bundle and senior talk with such starts charging me 15 dollars of a redo

150
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,720
 What do you think I'm gonna do

151
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,200
 for the quantity demanded in my personal life?

152
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,559
 Increase and decrease.

153
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,799
 Please, huh?

154
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,039
 Increase, no, I'm gonna increase this

155
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,559
 and you can't go as free and delicious.

156
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,639
 Okay, good joke.

157
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,080
 Okay, I would decrease my consumption

158
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,960
 of senior thought about eating the next list of delicious

159
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,159
 and I'll over my heart.

160
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,279
 I just can't afford a $15 burrito.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,860
 I don't want someone else to worry.

162
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,120
 But something you may not have

163
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,759
 because you're gonna call the price of good prices.

164
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,600
 Re-simple.

165
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,580
 (mumbles)

166
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,120
 See you over here.

167
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,639
 Okay, all right.

168
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,200
 On a graph, very, very simple.

169
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 This is a demand schedule.

170
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,639
 All we're going to do is look at a graph on how the price of an ice cream cone and the

171
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,360
 wants to keep demanded is going to be graphed.

172
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,799
 So at $399, we expect 12.

173
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,320
 As the price increases to 50 cents, well, our quantity of demand is going to be a little

174
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 bit less.

175
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,879
 Notice I'm saying quantity of demand and I'm not saying demand.

176
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,240
 If our price increases to a dollar,

177
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,039
 or quantity demanded is going to be eight.

178
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,179
 Prices increase, quantity demanded decreases.

179
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,559
 Pretty simple.

180
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,960
 You have to know that.

181
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,500
 Okay.

182
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,720
 And let's talk about the demand curve.

183
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,000
 The demand curve is simply a demand, a demand schedule graph.

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 It's a graph of the relationship between a price of a good and a quantity of random.

185
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So if I say let's drop some demand curves today.

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 We need to know that it is simply by someone access quantity demanded on another axis.

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,159
 That's it.

188
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,039
 What is this using? Is that a thing?

189
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
 You know what the delay is?

190
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:58,879
 You're not in it. (indistinct)

191
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,179
 - It's a small fan, it's 9B. It's not the nice thing. I think I might be.

192
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,500
 Stop the nice.

193
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 [INAUDIBLE]

194
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,000
 You used to have a lot of-- well, this is-- I think you'll hold it recently.

195
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Okay, that's the manager.

196
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Everyone.

197
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 I think it says yes.

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Okay.

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Now, let's see what that demand schedule, how it looks graph.

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 You guys know if I gave you this, this demand schedule, you could graph that.

201
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Yeah, for example, put price on one side, quantity on the other side, plot it.

202
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Okay, for example, it's just going to look like this.

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,559
 Price and I could come as it goes up our quantity. Our quantity management is going to go down. All we're going to do is put that--

204
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,080
 those won't be wrapped.

205
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,600
 Put them on the table like that.

206
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,080
 I just put it as an assignment.

207
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
 I just put it as an assignment.

208
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
 [INAUDIBLE]

209
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
 [INAUDIBLE]

210
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
 [INAUDIBLE]

211
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
 [INAUDIBLE]

212
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
 [INAUDIBLE]

213
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,000
 [INAUDIBLE] OK, press the nice and jump. There it is, it's yours, it's not something.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Okay, press the nice button. There it is.

215
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
 Now, notice, if we move from this point to this point,

216
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,600
 any point along the line, the only way we move is based on the price.

217
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,200
 And that is where you're going to get confused.

218
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,320
 Price moves it. Price does not shift it. on price and that is where you're going to get confused. Right? Move.

219
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,679
 So price does not shift it.

220
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,919
 What moves along the line?

221
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,720
 Price.

222
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,639
 That is where you're going to get very, very confused.

223
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,000
 So price affects quantity demanded.

224
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,159
 Price is not going to affect demand.

225
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,179
 And careful with the language price equals movement boxy demand

226
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,679
 Okay, let's talk about market managers individual man. This is very simple market demand

227
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:19,600
 But first it's not the whole individual demands for particular good or service all the sum people the economics term macro

228
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
 everybody

229
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,679
 But some of all individual demands for a particular good or

230
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,200
 terrible.

231
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,000
 What is the overall demand of Western high school

232
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
 senior, senior talker Maria?

233
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,759
 Pretty new handle.

234
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,360
 The heavily.

235
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,279
 The handle that her dad works at. I think her family owns me.

236
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,879
 Yeah, I'll finish that week. I think her grandpa or not her dad doesn't work that well.

237
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,080
 So yeah, I think that I'll, I thought I talked about senior talk about a great

238
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,360
 dream then, not one of my classes. So, my family is senior talk to us. I did the head down

239
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,960
 account. Are you serious? I spent about $1,000 they last. They said give us. Un-cribe it.

240
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
 Didn't happen.

241
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
 Yeah.

242
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
 Well, you can just say, "There's no fail."

243
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
 Or, "You go into the person."

244
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,960
 And can't even tell me about that, because someone would be like, "There's just voter."

245
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,960
 And then, "You're absorbed."

246
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,960
 There's no sense of humor.

247
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,000
 Don't get jokes. There's no sense of humor.

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Don't get jokes.

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 No, these things.

250
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Comedy is a dead man.

251
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Don't forget the reasons.

252
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 There you go.

253
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 The graphic ladies and followers.

254
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 The individual demand curve are thumbs horizontally to obtain the market demand curve. I'm going to show you two individual demand curves combining each of the market demand curves.

255
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Okay.

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 One individual second individual final margin one and so far that no rocket science going on.

257
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 No rocket. No, right. Thank.

258
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:49,920
 Very slowly. [inaudible] Okay, let's put it two drops.

259
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,680
 When we have stock, when we have gems, when the price is $2, we'll demand more hydrogen

260
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
 cups.

261
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
 We'll give you a few other four hydrogen cups.

262
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
 Gems demand.

263
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,680
 When the price is $2, we'll demand three hydrogen cups.

264
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,279
 So all we're going to do is we're going to take our $2 point,

265
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:19,200
 four and three and put it in a market banker. Very, very simple. We're not doing rocket science had a little math here. $2, market man is seven quantity of ice cream time between the two at $2. For example,

266
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,599
 okay, let's move on for you to set maybe a little more

267
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:31,759
 Okay, let's move on to you a second, maybe a little more unzipped. Now, let's talk about a change in quantity.

268
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,960
 It changes quantity, man.

269
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,759
 It's going to be a movement along the demand curve.

270
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,599
 I might ask you to say that I don't think.

271
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,799
 Because you will start to get confused.

272
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,079
 I am simply talking about a movement along the demand curve.

273
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,079
 And that is going from point eight here.

274
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,000
 And you want to be there.

275
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,480
 That's a movement that is not going to come out

276
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,039
 by a change in the price.

277
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,000
 A change in the price. Change in the price. Change in the price. Change in the price. Change in the price.

278
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Change in the price.

279
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Change in the price.

280
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Change in the price.

281
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Change in the price.

282
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Change in the price.

283
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Change in the price.

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Change in the price.

285
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Change in the price.

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Change in the price.

287
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Change in the price.

288
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Change in the price.

289
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Change in the price. Walk with the demand is a movement based on price and change. Okay.

290
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Okay.

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Okay.

292
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Okay.

293
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Okay. Okay, engine quality management.

294
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,400
 It's a moving along manager.

295
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,240
 We got that?

296
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
 Okay, there it is.

297
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,960
 It's grounded way.

298
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,319
 We're gonna change the quality of demand.

299
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,799
 At $1, we're gonna require

300
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,599
 a $10,000 to the quality of demand.

301
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,119
 We're saving the movement this way on this line.

302
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,359
 It simply wanna be based on the price change.

303
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,640
 Changing the quantity demanded demanded not the demand.

304
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,920
 Two different things we're going to talk about.

305
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,119
 So a tax, for example, a tax on sellers of ice cream cones

306
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,839
 raises the price of ice cream cones

307
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:35,240
 and results in a movement along the demand curve.

308
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,839
 So we're going to change the price.

309
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,400
 Let's say it goes up from $1 to $2.

310
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,400
 And $1 we're going to require eight ice cream cones.

311
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,599
 We're going to move it up to $2.

312
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,079
 It's going to be four four because we change the price.

313
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,480
 And it's going to move to that.

314
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
 It's simple.

315
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
 It's.

316
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,279
 Emily, are you confused?

317
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,920
 You're looking confused.

318
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,400
 If you are, now is the time to speak.

319
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,440
 Right now is just projects.

320
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,799
 It's like a terrible basketball practice.

321
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,880
 You're not understanding what play.

322
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,000
 It's like a thousand times understanding of traffic questions because any, and you're not understanding what play it's like a thousand times understanding traffic questions because any game you don't understand what play you need.

323
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 We both can do that.

324
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 You think.

325
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,640
 Thanks. based on a change in price. Now we're gonna talk about how do we get that graph to go this way or how do we get that graph

326
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,519
 to go up this way to change the overall demand

327
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,680
 where price is irrelevant and price is not a factor.

328
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,920
 Now, and we're gonna call these ships.

329
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,279
 This is where you will have to be able to tell me

330
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,759
 our graph that it's a demand graph

331
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,420
 goes out that way and same goes in that way.

332
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,759
 And some of you already told me a lot of these are going to be exactly

333
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,519
 in but we're going to kind of give you what's happened to talk about it.

334
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,279
 So change in demand. You notice how I did not pay the payment

335
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,359
 stock in payment. I did change in demand. It's a little

336
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,960
 language that's going to be very important and it's very

337
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,200
 you're going to have to be very important and it's very important.

338
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,720
 You're going to have to be very slimy for paying attention to the words that a lot of

339
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,400
 tests and the words sound speaking right now.

340
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
 Change demand, not changing promise.

341
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,039
 Now we're not going to talk about price.

342
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,039
 Price is irrelevant.

343
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,039
 Yeah.

344
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,039
 Number one, check the demand curve.

345
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
 Here's the right or the left.

346
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,000
 A shift in the demand curve. You just sort of write it's for the left.

347
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 How much we're going to demand a peanut butter, how much we can demand of that law of detail.

348
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 How much we can demand of those eggs.

349
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Yes.

350
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Yes.

351
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But you will always have like a default line to set up.

352
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 So this might be, this might be, they would take me one.

353
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Okay.

354
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 One.

355
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 This might be the man to.

356
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Okay.

357
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Laura. Laura, what is the last one? - No.

358
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 - Okay.

359
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 - No, it's not.

360
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 - All right.

361
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 - All right.

362
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 - No, it's not.

363
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 - No, that's not something.

364
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 - Okay, the first thing.

365
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 - It's not something that you got out of it.

366
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 - Not again.

367
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 - You know.

368
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 - No.

369
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 - Excuse me.

370
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 - Okay.

371
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 - Right, yes.

372
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 - Yes.

373
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 - Are you?

374
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 - Yes.

375
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 - Is that all the part of the board?

376
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 - No. - Okay. - I have to, for the board, no. Okay, second thing.

377
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 It's going to be called by change that voltage,

378
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 the quantity demanded at every price.

379
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Any change that comes up on the quantity demanded at every price.

380
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Whatever the price is.

381
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Any change.

382
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Okay.

383
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And post, thanks.

384
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Make sure everybody is understanding.

385
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And.

386
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 You know,

387
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 movements.

388
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And.

389
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 It's.

390
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 It's.

391
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 It's.

392
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 It's. It's a really interesting.

393
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So, the manual.

394
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Yeah, we follow your own.

395
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Oh, you don't have any grandi.

396
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Yeah.

397
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 That's good.

398
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 That's good. One of those. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]

399
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

400
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

401
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

402
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

403
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

404
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

405
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

406
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

407
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 [INAUDIBLE]

408
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,039
 [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] and how do you say that, keep nice, hard at a time. I like it. You can see it all.

409
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,400
 You're hard.

410
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,960
 He's a really nice guy.

411
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,880
 He didn't really care about the way he choked back his leg.

412
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,960
 He didn't come from school and stuff.

413
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,200
 His image is unorganized.

414
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,279
 OK, we got this.

415
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,039
 And if I'm in this.

416
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:12,839
 OK, now let's talk about that.

417
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,880
 If Bryce moves it and is determined on once he's made,

418
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 let's talk about how long does he get to about that looks like this.

419
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,400
 Will we actually move our overall demand,

420
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,079
 either increase it or decrease it?

421
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,839
 We're going to use an acronym.

422
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,740
 And the acronym is going to be POST.

423
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,240
 So, ISS.

424
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,160
 That is gonna help you memorize it.

425
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And you will be required to remember and define POST.

426
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,680
 You're often gonna give the beginning scenarios

427
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
 in the moment,

428
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,200
 but you're gonna have to know what specific

429
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,920
 post is out on other circumstances. So the shifters of demand, not the

430
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,920
 shifters of quantity demand in me. No demand does not equal quantity

431
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,480
 demand in. Know that movement does not equal a shift.

432
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,599
 Guys will fall without a trap. Very easily. Number one, take the preference.

433
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,000
 That's gonna shift. For example, you think a lot of children like onions.

434
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:25,279
 Dollars, you think dollars like onions? No, generally they know. Add people grow though, do their taste change?

435
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,039
 No.

436
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,359
 Yes.

437
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,599
 Add people grow, do their preference change?

438
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,359
 Yes.

439
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,200
 If your taste and preference has changed,

440
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,640
 that can move these to man third.

441
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,960
 When I was a kid, I hated onions.

442
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,839
 Absolutely despised them.

443
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,680
 My mom would put onions in spaghetti.

444
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,799
 My dad used a pair of books with onions in spaghetti.

445
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,880
 Oh, yeah, see, my mom does too.

446
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,119
 And I absolutely still hated it, like, moms.

447
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,119
 It's that crap out of it.

448
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,359
 And you know what mom said when I didn't want to eat it?

449
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,799
 Wait, I'll take a guess.

450
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,720
 - Do that.

451
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,559
 - Yeah, actually, too.

452
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,799
 You put it in my mom's room,

453
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,039
 you put it on the side.

454
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,200
 Tough crap, but she would trust and Spanish.

455
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,359
 Tough crap, people.

456
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,720
 Peter, 200.

457
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,079
 That's good.

458
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,400
 That's it.

459
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,640
 Okay, take the process number one.

460
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,079
 Number two is going to be other,

461
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,599
 I mean, later, it's yours.

462
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,240
 Now, this one's gonna have two little subtitles. So I would put like

463
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,880
 other way to go. So I'm heading and something. Okay, it's other way to do it. So I do think

464
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,960
 other way. Last last word, when I asked that interview, a student gave a great answer.

465
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,319
 A student said, well, I would expect the demand for peanut butter to change if something happened

466
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:51,920
 to the quantity of bread. Well, what do you mean by that? Well, if there was some type of disease that altered the amount of grain available to make bread as peanut butter and bread or goods

467
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,599
 that go together, I would expect people to buy less peanut butter because there's less bread.

468
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:06,640
 Does that make logical sense? Yeah, it makes a complete sense. If there was a bug that wiped out the wheat crop

469
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,640
 across the nations and across the world,

470
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,480
 making red less available,

471
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,759
 people wouldn't buy as much peanut butter

472
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,759
 because they're complimentary goods.

473
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:19,920
 People use peanut butter on bread all the time.

474
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:28,000
 If the cattle developed a virus or bacteria that wiped out some of the world's cattle.

475
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Do you think we buy less bread?

476
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Wine, what does cattle produce at weddings? - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

477
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,839
 - I'm sorry.

478
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,660
 - I'm sorry.

479
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,500
 - I'm sorry.

480
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,339
 - I'm sorry.

481
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:49,180
 - I'm sorry.

482
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,019
 - I'm sorry.

483
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:50,859
 - I'm sorry.

484
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:51,700
 - I'm sorry.

485
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,539
 - I'm sorry.

486
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,380
 - I'm sorry.

487
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,220
 - I'm sorry.

488
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,059
 - I'm sorry.

489
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,059
 - I'm sorry.

490
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:56,900
 - I'm sorry.

491
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,740
 - I'm sorry.

492
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,579
 - I'm sorry.

493
00:28:58,579 --> 00:28:59,420
 - I'm sorry.

494
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,259
 - I'm sorry.

495
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:01,099
 - I'm sorry.

496
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:01,940
 - I'm sorry.

497
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,779
 - I'm sorry.

498
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:03,619
 - I'm sorry.

499
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:04,460
 - I'm sorry.

500
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,920
 - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. What can you substitute? For example, if you're talking about something, you're going to need that.

501
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,079
 You're going to need that.

502
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,000
 Or change the math.

503
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,920
 If there's an Xbox, and then PlayStation comes out

504
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,160
 with PlayStation, it's going to affect the demand of Xbox,

505
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,000
 because there are substitute goods.

506
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,319
 Substitute goods.

507
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:32,000
 And substitute goods are usually going to decrease the demand because if I have an Xbox and then PlayStation comes out of the main PlayStation.

508
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 So when it comes out, hey, we're beginning to do the PlayStation.

509
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Maybe I might go by the PlayStation instead of the Xbox and my demand for Xbox is going to decrease.

510
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,319
 Not because the price changes at the Xbox

511
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,000
 because there's a substitute good.

512
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,759
 The Xbox could raise the price by $100

513
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,799
 and if somebody comes out and makes a PlayStation

514
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,359
 and I buy the PlayStation,

515
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,720
 has nothing to do with the price of the Xbox.

516
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,559
 As soon as there's a substitute good out there, okay?

517
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,960
 And pencils substitute goods.

518
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,880
 Another one under other good age goods

519
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,759
 can be very important for us to understand.

520
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,259
 It's going to be compliments.

521
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,440
 Compliments.

522
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,839
 You have to think of compliment each other.

523
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,559
 For example, bread and butter.

524
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,720
 Peanut butter and bread.

525
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,599
 Lamb and tuna fish.

526
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,440
 - Mm, mm-hmm.

527
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 - All of you are more than familiar with that for comedy? - Yes. and tuna fish. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

528
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 [inaudible]

529
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000

530

 [inaudible]

536
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,440
 [inaudible] [inaudible] - I'm gonna jell in. Next one, the E, it's expectations.

537
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:48,880
 Expectations.

538
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,039
 The example I gave last class period

539
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,279
 dealt with avocados.

540
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,119
 What did we get?

541
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,279
 You guys know where the United States gets

542
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,640
 more avocados?

543
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
 - Spectrales.

544
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,119
 - You know who, at this time,

545
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,640
 for ranses, Mexican avocados, apartments? - America. - America. You know who often times Horaces Mexican avocado parmes

546
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
 I'm here

547
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,319
 You guys know who often times are asses Mexican avocado

548
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,640
 They're a lot of the cartels do and oftentimes what cartels do in order to have an income source is they will kidnap

549
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:32,000
 Mexican avocado farmers white or daughter or son or themselves and they'll say if you want to your daughter back mother back white back you're gonna have to pay us $10,000 or give us 10 acres of your avocado.

550
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:46,500
 That's what the cartels do. Okay, so let's say. It kind of is happening. You guys don't kind of know that growth and power

551
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,400
 of the Mexican cartels.

552
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,700
 It's it's really gross.

553
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,900
 So it's.

554
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,400
 It's dangerous.

555
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,700
 OK, so let's say the cartels were to say, hey, whole world,

556
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,799
 hey, United States, you know what we're going to do?

557
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:04,400
 In January 1, 2025, the Mexican cartels,

558
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:28,200
 we're going gonna take over the or buy more, buy less of. Buy more, buy more. Because they're not expensive right now.

559
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
 Or if it's apples, and they're going to take over

560
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,759
 the couple orders, and they can go buy a bunch of apples

561
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,759
 right now.

562
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:35,359
 And I'm going to do something like that.

563
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,400
 Because you would expect the future, the price of it

564
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
 is to increase the transfer.

565
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,640
 But the expectation of a future event

566
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,000
 is going to then have a direct correlation to the end.

567
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,160
 In case of the case of the working

568
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,480
 with the bigger end goal.

569
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,359
 - Well, I was like, yeah, but now that one's different.

570
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:58,599
 (mumbles)

571
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,839
 - How many people have you got wiped over red?

572
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,119
 - There was just kind of a, you know,

573
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,039
 nobody said like,

574
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,180
 (indistinct)

575
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,720
 In regards to the first thing.

576
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,279
 But if COVID happened,

577
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:33,380
 it's setting people over.

578
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,279
 What's a better example?

579
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,680
 'Cause it's not like people get their shoes.

580
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,680
 It's not better.

581
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,720
 It's just, whatever nature decides besides and somebody's used it.

582
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,039
 But in COVID, it was more like, people have a toilet set.

583
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,599
 They didn't want to be left after it.

584
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,420
 It was a people have a choice of how my alcohol

585
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,720
 can fit in the toilet.

586
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,200
 Because when I went outside to watch my dog,

587
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,240
 every last recycle bin was just full of things.

588
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,720
 That's a choice you get to me just to leave.

589
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,119
 Where I'd like to look for something

590
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:25,000
 and before you get it let me talk to you okay you don't get to be like hey I need Okay, that's a good thing.

591
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 All right.

592
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Yeah, let's love you.

593
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 I am going to begin.

594
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Here's an example of interrupt.

595
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 No one, do you think that when I was younger, I was growing up?

596
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,840
 One of the items that my family ate a lot, especially as a child, was free volities and photos.

597
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,880
 - Invis, - Invis and rice.

598
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,920
 Why, I ate a lot of Invis and rice, kid?

599
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,039
 Other than the fact that like,

600
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,119
 you know, the bong dong thing and my mom is

601
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,960
 spanning two sheets of tea, it's very cheap and expensive.

602
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,000
 A good that we were to consider an inferior good.

603
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Not that feeds the brand's mark, but it's just considered a cheapest barrier good.

604
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 It's like Tom Rama.

605
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 I had a lot of Tom Rama when I was a kid too, and many of you will too when you're in color

606
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 because of me.

607
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,559
 However, when my mom's income increased and she got a little bit more education, a few

608
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:22,639
 more degrees, a little bit more experience, a better job.

609
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,719
 Do you think you made as much beans and rice?

610
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,480
 No.

611
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
 So he should tell me that it is a pump.

612
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,719
 He's going to affect the demand.

613
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:34,000
 He comes with me to affect the demand.

614
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,760
 Do you think I ate lobster tails when I was growing up?

615
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
 No.

616
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,079
 I was close.

617
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,199
 Do you think now, at a point in my life,

618
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:48,320
 do you think I buy as much beans and rice? It's nice. No, unless I want cultural, kind of, meal.

619
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
 Okay.

620
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,320
 And I'll make this on my grandkids.

621
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
 Not when I make it.

622
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
 It's just when I make it, it's like pigeon-free.

623
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,519
 So I'm not going to eat it.

624
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,400
 But if my income increases, I'm going to be more likely to buy goods considered new

625
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
 programs.

626
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,239
 So a normal good.

627
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,400
 We're going to call that any good that you buy when your income goes

628
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
 up.

629
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:17,880
 Because if I'm rich, why would I continue buying a couple noodles?

630
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,239
 I will.

631
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:27,000
 Again, you can easily say, well, Mr. Sputter, what if somebody is very frugal?

632
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,079
 What if somebody wants to just, "What if somebody really likes kapanoodles?"

633
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,519
 Of course, that happens.

634
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,760
 That's the what-it game.

635
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,960
 But economics isn't playing the what-it games, playing the Sedera's Paribus game.

636
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,440
 What is the most likely to happen when someone's income increases?

637
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,199
 And when someone's income increases, their purchase and consumption of normal goods increases.

638
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,679
 But beans and rice,

639
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,440
 top ramen, cup of noodles, hot dog, those are going to be considered inferior goods.

640
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,719
 So the opposite exists as well. As income goes down,

641
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,199
 or excuse me, as income goes up, you buy less of inferior goods.

642
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,880
 But as your income decreases,

643
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,760
 you will buy more inferior goods.

644
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:14,920
 Make sense?

645
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,760
 If you are poor, you're gonna buy cheap goods.

646
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,679
 If you make more money,

647
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,559
 you're gonna buy more expensive goods.

648
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,280
 Sederos Parovas.

649
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,800
 Assuming nobody's a cheapskate,

650
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,840
 assuming nobody's saving for some big purchase,

651
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,199
 assuming nobody's frugal,

652
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:30,519
 assuming that's not somebody's favorite food,

653
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,559
 because we could simply sit here all day long

654
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,639
 and say, well, let's just vote up.

655
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,480
 What if beans and rice is somebody's favorite food?

656
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,079
 And what if somebody just loves top ramen?

657
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,800
 Okay, yes, I understand it.

658
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,400
 That's the exception.

659
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,320
 That's could happen.

660
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,719
 But that's not what we're talking about when

661
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,119
 we talk about economics.

662
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,000
 OK, yes, it's going to be size of market.

663
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,800
 Size of market.

664
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,039
 Meaning there's a lot of people who

665
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,320
 will invite a particular product.

666
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,239
 The demand for hotel rooms will skyrocket

667
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,179
 in Portland building, I mean baseball stadium.

668
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,440
 Because all of those workers are gonna have to be shipped

669
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,599
 in from somewhere, purely not Portland.

670
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,639
 And they're gonna have to build a baseball stadium.

671
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,880
 They will have to stay somewhere

672
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,719
 for an extended credit time.

673
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,199
 Those buyers are going to be buyers of home hotel rooms.

674
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,119
 Because if that happens, there will be a thousand workers in downtown Portland, on south waterfront, trying to build a baseball stadium, and a lot of that needs a place to

675
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,679
 live. That's a size of market increase. And the last one is going to be special circumstances.

676
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:52,559
 For example, if there's a Winter Olympics, you demand for getting services going skyrocket. Yes. Yes. Special certain thing.

677
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,280
 Oh, yeah, can you pass it on? I can pay a billion can't help this. Thank you. What you got today,

678
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:05,280
 the title. Well, and it's a new bottle. Something you can stop that that I thought it didn't have my name. The team is a good place.

679
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,039
 Thank you.

680
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,039
 My turn to understand.

681
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,480
 You think it's curious.

682
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,239
 I don't know why this is not safe.

683
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,320
 I don't know.

684
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:49,000
 Yeah, all this. Now, that's probably why I'm too asked to sometimes confusing questions because people Thank you. Let me answer your your country.

685
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 Or the language. Please.

686
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Let's do it.

687
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 We need to do it.

688
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 You need to do it.

689
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 You need to do it.

690
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 This is the biggest.

691
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Yeah, this is what I was playing.

692
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,780
 Usually. Once we look at this picture, then what we're

693
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:14,300
 going to do in the packet earlier is passing out. Instead, demand curve. If the demand

694
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:20,639
 curve is going to be characterized by a default line, we will have D1. After you have D1, you

695
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,980
 can have a line that's going to move, that's going to shift the graph. I'm not talking

696
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,000
 about root in the graph, I'm talking to shift the graph. I'm not talking about looping the graph.

697
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 I'm talking about shifting your graph.

698
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 The switch needs to pay careful intention between quantity demanded and demand and movements versus shifts, because they both mean two different things.

699
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 This is talking about the shift.

700
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,199
 A shift is post. A movement is price.

701
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,800
 The interval attention.

702
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
 If we have a line here,

703
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,239
 we're going to follow the demand curve D1.

704
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,599
 If it moves out, there's an increase in demand.

705
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,280
 Not an increase in fonts and you may have it,

706
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
 but an increase in demand,

707
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,599
 it's going to move it out.

708
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,519
 It's going to be a new demand curve.

709
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:00,440
 If it moves in and demand decreases because of

710
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,119
 expectations, face and preferences change,

711
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,480
 expectations change, income bill, up or income goes down,

712
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,039
 it's going to move this way.

713
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,320
 Okay. It's going to be a decrease in demand,

714
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,280
 we're going to call that degree.

715
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,239
 That is why it's fundamentalist the United States government.

716
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,920
 We always look at what is

717
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,880
 the income of the average income of

718
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,679
 the United States citizens per capita per person.

719
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,039
 If the average income of

720
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,119
 the United States citizens increases,

721
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,480
 our government knows,

722
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,639
 okay, economically, if the income of individuals in the United States citizens increases, our government knows, okay, economically,

723
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:30,800
 if the income of individuals in the United States per capita increases, the demand for

724
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,719
 normal goods is going to increase as well. And then how do we increase our production

725
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:41,239
 possibilities for demand of a normal goods or income decreases? How do we shift that?

726
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:48,920
 And then if the demand for our income decreases in the United States, quick happen, that tells the United States government, you know, the, the

727
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,360
 equivalent of American citizens, this decreased by $10,000, meaning that Americans

728
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,559
 are going to buy more in periods. So how do we even get there or enough in period

729
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:05,079
 that someone buy all of it's connected? Okay. And that's what we're gonna do today, okay?

730
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:11,480
 So, next class period, all right?
