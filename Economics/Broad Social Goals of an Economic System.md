### 1. **Efficiency**
- Refers to how well scarce productive resources are allocated to produce the goods and services people want. 
- How well inputs (resources) are used in the production process to keep production costs as low as possible. 
	- Productive efficiency = fully using all available resources.
	- Allocative efficiency = production represents consumer preferences; marginal benefit = marginal cost. 
### 2. **Equity**
- Means what is **"fair"**
	- Economic actions and policies have to be evaluated in terms of what people think is right and wrong. 
	- Equity issues often arise in questions dealing with the distribution of income and wealth. 
	- Some people judge equity based on providing equal opportunity. 
	- Others judge based on equality of outcomes. 
### 3. **Freedom**
- Refers to such things as: 
	- The freedom for consumers to decide how to spend or save their incomes, 
	- the freedom of workers to change jobs and join unions, and
	- the freedom of individuals to establish new businesses or close old ones.
### 3. **Security**
- Refers to protecting consumers, producers, and resource owners from risks that exist in society. 
	- Each society must decide from which uncertainties individuals can and should be protected, and 
		- whether individuals, 
		- employers, or 
		- the government should provide or pay for this protection.
### 4. **Growth**
- Refers to increasing the production of goods and services over time. 
	- Economic growth is measured by changes in the level of real gross domestic product (GDP). 
	- A target annual growth rate of 3 to 4 % in real GDP has historically been considered to be reasonable and sustainable. 
	- Which raises the questions: 
		- Is it possible for an economy to continually grow? 
		- Is it necessary for an economy to continually grow? 
### 5. **Stability**
- Refers to maintaining stable prices and full employment and keeping economic growth reasonably smooth and ready. 
	- Price stability means avoiding inflation or deflation. 
	- Full employment occurs when an economy's scarce resources, especially labor, are fully utilized.
