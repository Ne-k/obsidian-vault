> How do we measure a nation's...

## 1. Measure a Nation's Income

> **Microeconomics** is the study of how individual households and firms make decisions and how they interact with one another in markets. 

> **Macroeconomics** is the stud of the economy as a whole. Its goal is it explain the economic changes that affect many households, firms, and markets at once. 

**Macroeconomics** answers questions like the following: 
- Why is the average income high in some countries and low in others? 
- Why do prices rise rapidly in some time periods while they are more stable in others? 
- Why do production and employment expand in some years and contract in others? 

## 2. The Measurement of Gross Domestic Product
- **Gross domestic product** (GDP) is a measure of the income or expenditures of an economy. 
- GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time...
- "GDP is the market value..." 
	- Output is values at market prices. 
- "... Of All..." 
	- Includes all items produced in the economy and legally sold in markets. 
- "... Final..."
	- It records only the value of final goods, not intermediate goods (the Value is counted only once).   
- "... Goods and Services..." 
	- That includes both tangible goods (food, clothing, cars) and intangible services (haircuts, housecleaning, doctor visits). 
- "... Produced..." 
	- It includes goods and services currently produced, not transactions involving goods produced in the past. 
- "... Within a country..." 
	- It measures the value of production within the geographic confines of a country. 
- "... In a Given Period of Time..." 
	- It measures the value of production that takes place within a specific interval of time, usually a year or a quarter (three moths). 

## 3. The Components of GDP
- GDP includes all items produced in the economy and sold legally in markets.
- What is Not Counted in GDP?
	- GDP excludes most items that are produced and consumed at home and that never enter the marketplace. 
	- It excludes items produced and sold illicitly, such as illegal drugs. 
--- 
- Consumption (C)
	- The spending by households on goods and services, with the exception of purchases of new housing. 
- Investment (I)
	- The spending on capital equipment, inventories, and structures, including new housing. 
- Government Purchases (G) 
	- The spending on goods and services by local, state, and federal governments.
	- Does not include transfer payments because they are not made in exchange for currently produced goods or services. 
- Net Exports (NX) 
	- Exports minus imports. 
### **Y = C + I + G + NX**

## 4. Real Versus Nominal GDP
- **Nominal GDP** values the production of goods and services at *current prices*. 
- **Real GDP** values the production of goods and services at *constant prices*
- GDP Deflator (Index #) 
	- = <u>Nominal GDP</u> * 100 
	- Real GDP

## Unemployment

### Identifying Unemployment
- The problem of unemployment is usually divided into two categories, the long-run problem and the short-run problem. 
- The natural rate of unemployment
- The cyclical rate of unemployment
#### The Natural Rate of Unemployment
- The **natural rate of unemployment** is unemployment that does not go away on it's own even in the long run. 
- It is the amount of unemployment that the economy normally experiences. 
- Expected unemployment (includes frictional and structural unemployment)

### Cyclical Unemployment
- One type of unemployment: Cyclical Unemployment
	- **Cyclical Unemployment** refers to the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its natural rate. 
	- It is associated with short-term ups and downs of business cycle. 
### Why Are there Always Some People Unemployed?
- **Frictional Unemployment** refers to the unemployment that results rom the time that it takes to match workers with jobs. 
	- In other words, it takes time for workers to search for the jobs that are best suited to their tastes and skills. 
- **Structural Unemployment** is the unemployment that results because the number of jobs available in some labor markets is insufficient to provide a job for everyone who wants one. 
	- Lacks The skill to be employed. 
## Describing Unemployment: Three Basic Questions
> - How does government measure the economy's rate of unemployment? 
> - What problems arise in interpreting the unemployment data?
> - How long are the unemployed typically without work? 

## How is Unemployment Measured?
- Unemployment is measured by the **Bureau Labor Statistics (BLS)**. 
	- It surveys 60,000 randomly selected households every month. 
	- The surveys is called the Current Population Survey. 
	- Classified as: Employed, unemployed, not in the labor force. 
## Employed Vs Unemployed
- The BLS considers a person an adult if he or she is over 16 years old. 
- A person is considered employed if he or she has spent some of the previous week working at a paid job. 
- A person is unemployed if he or she is on temporary layoff, is looking for a job, or is waiting for the start date of a new job. 
- A person who fits neither of these categories, such as a full-time student, homemaker, or retiree, is **not in the labor force.** 
## The Labor Force
- The **Labor Force** is the total number of workers, including both of the employed and the unemployed.
- The BLS defines the labor force as the sum of the employed and the unemployed. 

## The Unemployment Rate
- The unemployment rate is calculated as the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. 
> = `(# of unemployed X 100) / Labor Force`

## The Labor Force Participation Rate
- The **labor-force participation rate** is the percentage of the adult population that is in the labor force. 
> Labor-Force Participation Rate  
> = `(Labor Force X 100) / Labor Force`

## How Does the Unemployment Rate Measure What We Want It To?
- It is difficult to distinguish between a person who is unemployed and a person who is not in the labor force. 
	- **Discouraged workers**, people who would like to work but have given up looking for jobs after an unsuccessful search, don't show up in unemployment statistics. 
	- Other people may claim to be unemployed in order to receive financial assistance, even though they aren't looking for work. 


## Inflation

### What is Inflation
- **Inflation** refers to a situation in which the economy's overall price level is rising. 
	- Money supply grows faster than the supply of goods and services
- The **inflation rate** is the **percentage change** in the price level from the previous period. 

### Cost Push Inflation
- Increased production costs for a large section of the market create an increase in prices. 
### Demand Pull Inflation
- Demand exceeds production capacity thus creating an increase in prices. 
### The Inflation Rate is Calculated as Follows:
![[inflationrateformula.jpg]]

## The Consumer Price Index
- The consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the overall cost of the goods and services bought by a typical consumer. 
	- Used to monitor changes in the cost of living over time. 
	- When the CPI rises, the typical family has to spend more dollars to maintain the same standard of living. 
### How the Consumer Price Index is Calculated
> Consumer price index = (price of basket of goods and services / price of basket in base year) * 100

- Calculating the CPI and the inflation rate: Another example: 
	- Base year is 2002
	- Basket of goods in 2002 costs 1,200
	- The same basket in 2004 costs 1,236
	- CPI = (1,236 / 1,200) * 100 = 103
