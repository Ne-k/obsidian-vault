**Example**: Households provide labor to businesses, and businesses provide goods and services to households.


### Review Questions for Quiz #1

1. **Explain why people face trade-offs (use your economic reasoning)**:

   Equity is about fairness in the distribution of resources, while efficiency is about maximizing output with given resources. Economics studies how to balance these goals.

7. **Draw and explain a production possibilities frontier graph for an economy that produces apples and bread. What happens to this frontier if a disease kills half of the economyâ€™s apple trees?**:
   The PPF would shift inward for apples, showing a decrease in the maximum possible production of apples while bread production remains unchanged.

8. **Draw and accurately label a circular flow of economic activity graph**:
