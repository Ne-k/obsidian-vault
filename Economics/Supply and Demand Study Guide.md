* The effects of price controls (e.g., shortages, surpluses)
* Shortage
* Surplus
* Price
* Quantity supplied
* Quantity demanded

    * Shifting Curves

**Review Questions:**
1. What determines the quantity of a good that buyers demand?
    * **Demand**: Influenced by factors such as price, income, tastes, expectations, and the prices of related goods.
2. Does a change in consumers' tastes lead to a movement along the demand curve, or a shift in the demand curve? Does a change in price lead to a movement along the demand curve, or a shift in the demand curve?
    * **Change in tastes**: Shift in the demand curve.
    * **Change in price**: Movement along the demand curve.
3. Popeye's income declines, and as a result, he buys more spinach. Is spinach an inferior or a normal good? What happens to Popeye's demand curve for spinach?
    * **Inferior good**: Spinach is an inferior good.
    * **Demand curve**: Shifts to the right.
4. What determines the quantity of a good that sellers supply?
    * **Supply**: Influenced by factors such as price, production costs, technology, number of sellers, and expectations.
5. Does a change in producers' technology lead to a movement along the supply curve, or a shift in the supply curve? Does a change in price lead to a movement along the supply curve, or a shift in the supply curve?
    * **Change in technology**: Shift in the supply curve.
    * **Change in price**: Movement along the supply curve.
6. Define the equilibrium of a market. Describe the forces that move a market towards its equilibrium.
    * **Market Equilibrium**: The point where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.
    * **Forces**: Surpluses and shortages drive prices up or down until equilibrium is reached.
7. Explain each of the following statements using supply-and-demand graphs.
    a. "When a cold snap hits Florida, the price of orange juice rises in supermarkets throughout the country."
        * **Supply curve shifts left**: Due to lower supply, leading to higher prices.
    b. "When the weather turns warm in the Pacific Northwest every summer, the price of hotel rooms in Arizona plummets."
        * **Demand curve shifts left**: Due to lower demand in Arizona, leading to lower prices.
8. How does the effect of a price ceiling differ from the effect of a price floor?
    * **Price Ceiling**: Leads to shortages as the price is set below equilibrium.
    * **Price Floor**: Leads to surpluses as the price is set above equilibrium.
9. What does the term "elasticity" mean to economists?
    * **Elasticity**: Measures how much the quantity demanded or supplied responds to changes in price.
10. How do you calculate the price elasticity of demand? What is the equation?
    * **Equation**: Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) = % change in quantity demanded / % change in price.
11. What is the total revenue test for determining the price elasticity of demand? (Total Revenue & price increases)
    * **Total Revenue Test**: If total revenue changes in the opposite direction of price, demand is elastic. If total revenue changes in the same direction as price, demand is inelastic.
12. Give examples of goods that are considered to be price elastic.
    * **Price Elastic Goods**: Luxury items, non-essential goods.
13. Give examples of goods that are considered to be price inelastic.
    * **Price Inelastic Goods**: Necessities, essential goods like food and medicine.
