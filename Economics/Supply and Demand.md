## Demand

### What Is a Market?
- A **Market** is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. 
- The terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people... As they interact with one another in markets. 
- Buyers determine **Demand**
- Sellers determine **Supply**

### What Is Competition
- A **Competitive Market** is a market in which there are many buyers and sellers so that each has a negligible impact on the market price. 

### Demand
- **Quantity Demanded** is the amount of a good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. 
- Law of Demand
	- The **Law of Demand** states that, other things equal (ceteris paribus!), the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises. 
### The Demand Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Demanded
- **Demand Curve**
	- The **Demand Curve** is a graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded. 
	-  ![[Draw-a-Demand-Curve-Step-4-1.png]]
	- The price **Moves it**, not **Shift**
	- Price = movement in quantity demanded. 
### Market Demand versus Individual Demand
- The Market demand refers to the sum of all individual demands for a particular good or service. 
- Graphically, individual demand curves are summed horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.

#### Change in Quantity Demanded
- Movement along the demand curve. 
- Caused by a change in the price of the project
> ![[Change-in-Quantity-Demanded-vs-Change-in-Demand.png]]

### Shifts in the Demand Curve
- Change in **Demand**
	- A **shift** in the demand curve, either to the left or to right. 
		- **Shifting** the entire graph to either side. 
	- Caused by any change that alters the quantity demanded at every price. 
		- Whatever the price is, any change. 
- Price is irrelevant
- Move is != shift 

## The Shifters of Demand <u>TOEISS</u> (AKA The Determinants of Demand)
- <b><u>T</u>astes in Preferences</b>
- <b><u>O</u>ther related goods</b>
	- Substitute (Coke Vs. Pepsi, Xbox Vs. Nintendo Switch, etc.) 
	- Complements (Peanut Butter & Jelly, etc.)
- <b><u>E</u>xpectations </b>
- <b><u>I</u>ncome</b>
	- Normal Goods (Income goes up, you buy more of it) 
	- Inferior Goods (Income goes up, you buy less of it)
- <b><u>S</u>ize of Market (Number of Buyers)</b>
- <b><u>S</u>pecial Circumstances (e.g Winter Olympics)</b>

- Substitution effect
- The income effect
	- changes in price affect the purchasing power of consumers' income
- The law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
	- As you continue to consume a given product, you will eventually get less addition utility from each unit you consume.

## Supply

- **Quantity Supplied** is the amount of a good that sellers are willing and able to sell. 
- Law of Supply
	- The **Law of Supply** states that, other things equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises. 
- Supply schedule 
	- The **Supply Schedule** is a table that shows the relationship between the price of the good and the quantity supplied. 

> ![[Supply schedule.png]]
- Supply curve
	- The **Supply curve** is the graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. 
> ![[supply_curve_final-465c4c4a89504d0faeaa85485b237109.png]]

### Market Supply versus Individual Supply
- Market supply refers to the sum of all individual supplies for all sellers of a particular good or service. 
- Graphically, individual supply curve are summed horizontally to obtain the market supply curve. 
- Change in **Quantity Supplied**
	- Movement along the supply curve. 
	- Caused by a **change in price**

> 	![[images.png]]
### Shifts in the Supply Curve
- Change in Supply
	- A shift in the supply curve, either to the left or right. 
	- Caused by a change in a determinant other than price. 

## Shifters of the Supply Curve... <u>STORES</u>! (The Determinants of Supply)
- <b><u>S</u>ellers</b>
- <b><u>T</u>echnology</b>
- <b><u>O</u>ther Outputs</b>
	- Final product
- <b><u>R</u>esources (Input Prices)</b>
	- Labor 
	- Ingredients
	- What takes to make it
- <b><u>E</u>xpectations</b>
- <b><u>S</u>ubsidies and taxes</b>
	- Giving money to some money or business to supply something. Tax credit.

## Supply and Demand Coming Together

1. Equilibrium 
2. Price Floors
3. Price Ceilings
4. Price Elasticity of Demand

- **Equilibrium** refers to a situation in which the price has reached the level where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. 
- **Equilibrium Price** 
	- The price that balances quantity supplied and quantity demanded. 
	- On a graph, it is the price at which the supply and demand curves intersect. 
> ![[market_clearing_price.png]]
- **Equialibrium Quantity**
	- The quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at the equilibrium price. 
	- On a graph, it is the quantity at which the supply and demand curves intersect.

> **The point is the equilibrium, the Y axis is the equilibrium price, and the X axis is the equilibrium quantity**

## Equilibrium

- ### **Surplus**
	- ![[surplusformula-graph2.webp]]![[unnamed.gif]] ![[291_3.jpg]]
		- When the price > equilibrium price, then quantity supplied > quantity demanded. 
			- There is an excess of 
- ### **Shortage**
	- When the price < equilibrium price, then quantity demanded > the quantity supplied. 
		-  ![[291_3.jpg]]
			- There is excess demanded or a shortage. 
			- Supplies will raise the price due to too many buyers chasing too few goods, thereby moving towards equilibrium.

> When the **demand is higher** than the supply, sellers lower the price.
> When the **demand is lower** than the supply, sellers raise the price.

- ### Law of Supply and Demand
	- The claim that the price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded for that good into balance. 

## Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium

- Shifts in Curves versus Movement along Curves
	- A **shift** in the supply curve is called a **change in supply**. 
	- A **movement along** a fixed supply curve is called a **change in quantity supplied**.
	- A **shift** in the demand curve us called a **Change in Demand**
	- A **movement along** a fixed demand curve is called a **change in quantity demanded**. 

## Price Ceilings

> Max price a seller is allowed to charge, the legal limit 
> ![[price-ceiling1.png]]

- When a **price ceiling** is set, **a shortage occurs**. For the price that the ceiling is set at, there is **more demand** than there is at the equilibrium price. 
	- Rent control 

## Price Floor

> The minimal legal price
> ![[Price-FLOOR.png]]

- A price floor is the **lowest legal price** a commodity can be sold at. price floors are used by the government to **prevent prices from being too low.**
	- Minimum wage 
	- There is less quantity demanded than quantity supplied. This creates a **surplus**
## Price Elasticity of Demand
> ![[Price-elasticity-of-Demand-1.webp]]
- **Price Elasticity of Demand**: The measure of how much quantity demanded changes relative to price change. 
	- Long-run demanded is usually **more elastic** than short-run demand. 
		- **% change is less 1 = inelastic**
		- **% change is 1 or more = elastic**
