### Pg. 1
- How would you identify an ideal parent? What kind of parent would you want to be? Do your parents adhere to your definition? 
	- I think someone who is moderate strict but also give their kids some form of freedom, like not too much or too little, because too much freedom their kid won't understand rules, while too little freedom their kids will be a rule listener but won't have the sense of themself. I think my parents follow that idea. 
- How important is consistency and routine? Do we need routine in order to create cleaner pathways to find success, or is it more important to lean with disarray and uncertainty? 
	- While the kid is young, I think a semi-consistent routine is viable to create a cleaner pathway for success, but occasionally deviate from it to teach the kid what is orderly or disorderly.

## Pg. 4
### The War Prayer
1. What is the mood or tone of the first three paragraphs? What language gives you this message? 
	1. The mood is patriotic and exotic, because in the first three paragraphs there is a war going on and they don't seem scared in any way, kind of like the fourth of July. 
2. What is the point of the story the messenger tells the crowd about praying for rain? What is he trying to make them understand? 
	1. He is trying to say that if you try and pray for the good, there is the possibility that a negative will happen to someone or something else in return for that positive. 
3. Twain has created a satire about patriotism, war, and violence. What do you think his indented message is? 

Reflection: What is the relationship between war a peace? Can one bring about the other? Cite evidence from this text, your own experience, and other literature, art, or history in your answer.

### Book Club Discussion #1
1. Has the story gone the way that you expected? Why/Why not? 
2. What relationships between characters have formed in the most recent reading that you did? What new relationships do they have to their environment? 
3. What is one intentional/interest strategy that the author uses in this book to enhance the story or our understanding of characters? 
4. What points of confusion still remain? Do you think these are intentional (Does the author leave this confusion on purpose), or unintentional? What is the effect of this confusion
5. Discussion Questions: 
	1. How does Liesel's character evolve throughout the story? What key events shape her growth, and how does she influence those around her?
	2. In what ways does _The Book Thief_ explore the duality of human nature during times of war? How do the characters reflect both the darkness and light of the human spirit?
	3. How does the unique perspective of Death as the narrator affect your understanding of the story right from the beginning? What emotions does this perspective evoke in you as a reader?

## Pg. 7

1. What kinds of endings do you prefer? Resolved, unresolved, happy, tragic, ambiguous, a twist, full circle, etc. What is an example of a story ending that you loved or an ending that you hated? 
	1. It kind of depends, if I'm reading something like a book, I'd like the story to be wrapped up and resolved by the time I get to the last page, but when it's a movie or show, depending on how good the storyline is, I'd prefer the ending to be unresolved so that I can continue watching waiting for the ending. 
		1. An example of a ending I hated comes from a movie called Inception, and how it ended was that it essentially left the watcher wondering what happened and the whole conflict of the main character wasn't really resolved, it left at a abrupt ending. 
2. What kind of ending was your book? Did you like it? Did it make sense with the rest of the book? 
	1. The ending of the book was as expected when it comes to the holocaust, Max, the Jew got arrested, Hitler died, and Liesel died of old age, nothing really surprising but all of it did make sense when it comes to the book, though something that piqued by interest was what did Death mean when he said "I am hunted by humans", like what does he imply. 
3. What kinds of story choices r stylistic elements did the writer use to foreshadow or set up the ending or later events of the story? 
	1. The book's narrator is death, and death at some point in the book said that it doesn't like surprises and straight up told us what would happen by the end of the book, such as Author Burg's death (though it's not related), and Rudy's death. 
4. What does this story reveal about the humanity in war? Where do we see examples of people overcoming loss and trauma? What epiphanies from this war story can lead to peace? 
	1. The book shows the harsh realities of war but also the enduring strength and compassion of individuals. It portrays how ordinary people, even under dire circumstances, can display extraordinary humanity. Characters like Hans Hubermann and Max Vandenburg exhibit deep empathy and courage, defying the brutality around them.
5. Create (3) of your own discussion questions of the Book Thief using our criteria: 
	1. Open ended
	2. Connects to text? 
	3. Can connect to the real world? 
	4. Clear and easy to understand? 
		1. **How does the narrator's unique perspective as Death shape the reader's understanding of the events and characters in "The Book Thief"?** 
		2. **In what ways does Liesel's love for books and words influence her relationships and actions throughout the novel?**
		3. **How does the theme of resistance manifest in the actions of various characters, and what parallels can you draw between their forms of resistance and those seen in real-world historical or contemporary contexts?**

### Letters of Wisdom

### 5 Minute Write
For me, <u>wisdom obviously means how knowledgeable you are in a subject or whatever</u>, as well as <u>the ability to learn from the mistakes you've made thus far and building off of that to teach others what and what not to d</u>o. Wisdom is some <u>form of knowledgeability</u>, such as if you've studied in the field of cybersecurity for x years, you would be counted as knowledgeable for that subject and have wisdom about it, or <u>if you've lived enough years in your life, say you're 60 or 50, people would count on you for wisdom about life</u> and what and what not to do or stay away from as they've been there and have experienced some of the things they'll be talking about, and it's something you could learn from them to make you a better person in general and learn not to make the same mistakes they've made.

### "Different Rules apply" by rogerbert.com Matt Zoller Seitz Questions
1. Why does Coates in the book between the world and me describe white people as, "Americans who believe they are white?" Do the articles that you read help to expand on why he might use this language? 
	1. Coates describes white people as "Americans who believe they are white" to emphasize that "whiteness" is a social construct rather than a biological reality.
2. The question of what it means to be black in America is a consistent question aimed at many black Americans, but why is it that we don't often see white people asked what it means to be white? does the article different rules apply help to answer this question? 
	1. The article explains that white people are rarely asked what it means to be white because their experiences are often considered the default or norm.
3. What are ideas you found interesting that you agreed with in your article? 
	1. Some interesting and agreeable ideas from the article include the importance of recognizing and addressing systemic racism, the necessity for open and honest conversations about race, and the role of privilege in shaping individuals' experiences and perspectives. The article underscores the need for empathy and understanding in bridging racial divides, which aligns with the broader goal of fostering a more just and equitable society.
4. What ideas in your articles did you find that you disagree with? 
	1. I'm not sure there's any ideas I disagree with. 

### Between the World and Me Questions
1. What challenges do you have n reading Coates' book? What kinds of challenges do you think Coates has in reading many of the books we have here at WLHS?
	1. 
2. What is the dream and why does Coates say, "Very few Americans will directly proclaim that they are in favor of black people being left to the streets But a very large number of Americans will do all they can to preserve the Dream?"
	1. The quote is often associated with suburban life, material wealth, and safety. This Dream is built on the exploitation and oppression of Black people, even if many Americans do not consciously acknowledge it. Coates argues that while few Americans openly support racial injustice, many are complicit in maintaining the systems and structures that perpetuate it, thereby preserving the Dream at the expense of Black lives.
3. Coates does refer subtly to the ways that America has used violence to attain and maintain power, what are some of these ways and why does he argue that African Americans are expected to be non-violent? 
	2. Coates points to slavery, segregation, lynching, and police brutality as ways America has used violence to maintain power. He argues that African Americans are expected to be non-violent to avoid challenging the status quo and established power structures.
4. One of Coates' final messages in the book is to "make your peace with chaos" is this a positive message to the reader? 
	1. Coates' message to "make your peace with chaos" can be seen as a realistic and empowering perspective. It encourages readers to acknowledge and accept the unpredictable and often harsh realities of life, particularly for African Americans facing systemic oppression. By making peace with chaos, individuals can find resilience and strength to navigate and challenge the injustices they encounter.
