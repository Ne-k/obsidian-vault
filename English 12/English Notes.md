### Pg. 1
- How would you identify an ideal parent? What kind of parent would you want to be? Do your parents adhere to your definition? 
	- I think someone who is moderate strict but also give their kids some form of freedom, like not too much or too little, because too much freedom their kid won't understand rules, while too little freedom their kids will be a rule listener but won't have the sense of themself. I think my parents follow that idea. 
- How important is consistency and routine? Do we need routine in order to create cleaner pathways to find success, or is it more important to lean with disarray and uncertainty? 
	- While the kid is young, I think a semi-consistent routine is viable to create a cleaner pathway for success, but occasionally deviate from it to teach the kid what is orderly or disorderly.

## Pg. 4
### The War Prayer
1. What is the mood or tone of the first three paragraphs? What language gives you this message? 
	1. The mood is patriotic and exotic, because in the first three paragraphs there is a war going on and they don't seem scared in any way, kind of like the fourth of July. 
2. What is the point of the story the messenger tells the crowd about praying for rain? What is he trying to make them understand? 
	1. He is trying to say that if you try and pray for the good, there is the possibility that a negative will happen to someone or something else in return for that positive. 
3. Twain has created a satire about patriotism, war, and violence. What do you think his indented message is? 

Reflection: What is the relationship between war a peace? Can one bring about the other? Cite evidence from this text, your own experience, and other literature, art, or history in your answer.
