- A modern conflict that originated in the **20th century**.
- Roots of the conflict - involving competing historical claims to the same **stretch of land** - go back **thousands of years**.
- Jewish roots in the area began between 1800 and 1500 B.C.E when the **Hebrew people** migrated into **Canaan** (now Israel).
- 1000 B.C.E: Their decedents **formally established** the kingdom of Israel with **Jerusalem** as it's capital. 
- Israel soon split into **two kingdoms** and was frequently under the control of **foreign conquerors**: the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, **Greeks**, and ultimately the **Romans**. 
- Despite repeated conquests, Jews retained their **separate identity**, mostly due to their **religious beliefs**. 
- Jews were (are) **monotheists** (one God), while thei neighbors were polythesis (**multiple** Gods). 
	- This set the Jews apart and instilled in them the idea that the territory of **Israel** was their **"promised land."**
- Jewish **majority** ended when the Roman Empire **expelled** the Jewish population from Israel following a failed **revolt against Roman** rule in 152 C.E
- For the next 1,800 years, the majority of Jews lived in **scattered** diasporas (ethnic communities) **outside of traditional homeland**) across Europe and the **Middle East**.
- Romans renamed the land '**Palaestinia**' and was inhabited by a small group of Jews **gradually returning** to the area. 
- 7th century C.E.: Palestine came under the **control of Arabs** who introduced into the region the Arabic **language** Background to the Palestinian Israeli Conflict and the religion of **Islam**
- A Jewish **minority** remained in the area (**10%** of population) from 7th century to mid 20th century. 
- The majority of inhabitants were **Arabic-speaking Palestinians**. 
- Most Palestinians are **Muslims**, but there is also a significant number of **Palestinian Christians**  
- Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived together **relatively peacefully** during the centuries that Palestine was part of the **Ottoman Empire** (1517 - 1918)
- However, the situation has changed over the course of the years. 
- The struggle between Jews and Palestinians developed as a product of **modern nationalism** in Europe and the Middle East during the **19th century**. 
- Rising nationalism had **major repercussions** for the Jewish diasporas of Europe. 
- Jewish had an opportunity, but **felt pressure**, to assimilate and **become members** of the newly emerging 'nations' in which they lived. 
	- This gave **advantages** but also required them to give up some of **their identity**. 
- Nationalism also fanned the flames of **anti-semintism** as Jews were seen has '**foreigners**' hindering the development of national **unity**.
- As attacks on Jews increased, Jews responded by developing their own from of nationalism: the **Zionist movement**
- Inspired by Zionism, small groups of Jews **left Europe** and set up farming settlements in **Palestine**, which was then part of the **Ottoman** Empire. 
- At first, settlements were **small** and then the newcomers faced little opposition from the **local population**. Jews were still less than **10%**
- However tensions mounted **during and after** the war 
- European (**mostly British** policies during World War I played a major role starting **starting a conflict** between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East. 
- Ottoman Empire (**Palestine included**) was allied with Germany and Austria **against** Great Britain and it's allies. 
- The British entered into negotiations with an Arab leader and planned **a revolt** against Ottoman Empire.
- 1915: During this discussions, the British **promised the Arabs** an independent state after the war. 
- Arab leaders believed that their people would be **united** as one large, and would include Palestine. 
- Western powers had other ideas, secretly signing an **agreement** to divide most of the area into Fresh and British-controlled '**mandates**'. 
- To make matters more complicated, the British courted international Jewish support by issuing the **Balfour Declaration**, which supported the concept of a Jewish **homeland** in Palestine.
- Basically, control of Palestine was promised to three different groups: **The Arabs, British, and Jews**!
- Which WWI ended and the British took charge of the Palestinian mandate...

- Fears grew as Jewish immigration increased grammatically, particularly after the rise of Hitler's power in Germany. 
- To Jews fleeing from persecution in Europe, Palestine was one of the few...
- For Palestinians, the arrival of a large Jewish immigrant population altered the **balance of the population**, displaced many people from their land, and threatened their goal of establishing an independent Arab state in the region. 
- Violence soon erupted between the groups. 
- The situation deteriorated in the immediate aftermath of the World War II. 
- Survivors of the Holocaust swelled the number of Jewish immigrants to the region, and the Allied victors, horrified by the revelation of large-scale genocide in Europe, were reluctant to stop them. 
- As violence between Jews and Arabs **grew**, the British declared its Mandate over Palestine to be **unworkable**, turning control of the area over to the United Nations. 
- In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Brit widthdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel. It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews. 
- Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been underlying...
- Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians **fled or were forced out** of their homes in what they call **Al Nakba**, pr the "**Catastrophie**"
- By the time the fighting ended in a **ceasefire** the following year, Israel controlled **most of the terrirory**. Jordan occupied land which became known as the west bank, and egypt occupied gaza. 
	- Israelis call this war the war of independence,
