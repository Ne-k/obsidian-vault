1. The Romani people, also known as Gypsies, are one of Europe's largest and most marginalized ethnic minorities with a rich cultural heritage that spans centuries across the continent; however, they have historically faced significant discrimination and persecution which culminated in the Porajmos or Romani Holocaust during World War II when hundreds of thousands were murdered by Nazi forces alongside Jews and others. 
2. Believed to have originated from the Indian subcontinent and migrating through Persia into Europe over several waves between the 11th century onwards, Roma today form an incredibly diverse group with their own dialects, cultural traditions, and social structures; yet they continue to suffer from lingering stereotypes rooted in historical misconceptions such as being portrayed as deceitful wanderers stemming from a false belief that they came from Egypt and face ongoing challenges including systemic racism despite post-World War II efforts for recognition and justice.

1. Despite efforts to improve their situation over recent decades, the Roma community continues to suffer from widespread discrimination, marginalization, and economic hardship throughout much of Europe. They are frequently relegated to impoverished living conditions with limited access to quality education and healthcare and encounter significant obstacles in employment and housing due to racial prejudice. The Roma face systemic barriers that compound their poverty and social exclusion; these include hate crimes, segregation, gender-based violence against Roma women, cultural devaluation by the dominant society, legal exclusivity resulting in minimal political representation for decision-making processes all contributing factors that perpetuate human rights violations against this minority group.
