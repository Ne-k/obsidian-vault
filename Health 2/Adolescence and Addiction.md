## Adolescent Brain and Risk of Addiction
- Adolescence is a critical period where the brain is susceptible to **lifetime addiction** due to its ongoing development.
- The **prefrontal cortex**, responsible for reasoning, grows in pre-teen years but is pruned back during adolescence.
  - This pruning increases **impulsive, risk-taking behavior** and vulnerability to addiction.
- **Statistics on Alcohol Use:**
  - Teens starting to drink by age 13 have a **43% chance of becoming alcoholics**.
  - Those starting at 21 have only a **10% chance**.

## Definition of Addiction
- **Addiction**: A chronic (lifelong) condition involving compulsive substance use or activities despite negative consequences.
- Impacts:
  - **Health**: Severe physical and mental health issues.
  - **Relationships** and **Quality of Life**: Deterioration in personal and social aspects.
- Early intervention is crucial to mitigate the effects of addiction.

## Is Addiction a Disease?
- Yes, addiction is a **chronic brain disorder**, not a matter of willpower or bad decisions.
- Defined by the **American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)**.

## Types of Addiction
1. **Substance Addictions (Substance Use Disorders, SUDs)**:
   - Substance Use Disorders (as per DSM-5) include:

     - **Stimulants** (e.g., cocaine, Adderall¬Æ)
     - **Nicotine** (e.g., cigarettes, e-cigarettes)
   - Commonality: Activate the brain's reward system, causing pleasure and potential addiction.
   - SUDs range from **mild to severe**, with **addiction** as the most severe form.

2. **Non-Substance Addictions (Behavioral Addictions)**:
