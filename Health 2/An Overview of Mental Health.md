> Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing how we handle stress, connect with others, and make choices throughout life. It's deeply intertwined with physical health; each profoundly impacts the other, with challenges like chronic illness or overwhelming stress affecting our mental state. Mental illnesses are more common than we might realize, affecting over one in five U.S. adults, arising from a complex interplay of factors like adverse childhood experiences, biological imbalances, substance use, and feelings of isolation.
