# Benefits and Risks of Cannabinoids

## Definitions and Background
- **Cannabis**: A genus of flowering plants (indica, sativa, ruderalis).
  - Low THC strains used for hemp; high THC strains for recreational/medicinal use.
  - Example: **Sativex** ‚Äì an oral cannabis extract spray.
- **Cannabinoids**: Compounds targeting cannabinoid receptors.
  - **Endocannabinoids**: Naturally produced, bind CB1 and CB2 receptors.
  - **Phytocannabinoids**: Plant-derived, e.g., THC, CBD.
  - **Synthetic cannabinoids**: Man-made compounds.
- **Endocannabinoid System**:
  - **Receptors**: CB1 (CNS, inhibit neurotransmitter release), CB2 (immune/nerve cells).
  - **Ligands**: Anandamide (AEA), 2-AG; others such as PEA.
  - **Enzymes**: Regulate synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids.

## Benefits of Cannabinoids
1. **Antiemetic**:
   - Approved for post-chemotherapy nausea/vomiting (e.g., Marinol).
2. **Anorexia Treatment**:
   - Approved for AIDS-induced anorexia.
3. **Anti-Spasticity**:
   - Effective for managing spasticity disorders.
4. **Anticonvulsant**:
   - Focus on **CBD** for epilepsy.
5. **Neuroprotective**:
   - Studied for Alzheimer‚Äôs and TBI.
6. **Anti-Tumor**:
   - Evidence of tumor growth inhibition in preclinical studies.
7. **Anti-Inflammatory**:
   - CB2 activation reduces inflammation and associated pain.
8. **Pain Management**:
   - Especially effective for neuropathic pain (THC+CBD).

## Risks of Cannabinoids
### Short-Term Risks:
- **Psychosis**:
  - 1.5‚Äì2.4x risk of psychotic illness if usage begins before age 25.
  - Factors: childhood trauma, genetic predisposition, family history.
- **Cognitive Decline**:
  - Recreational use in adolescence linked to impaired memory and decreased cognitive function.
  - Studies face confounding factors like other substance use.

### Long-Term Risks:
1. **Respiratory**:
   - Smoking linked to bronchitis and potential cancers; reduced with vaporizers.
2. **Dependence**:
   - ~9% of users develop dependence; higher (~18%) in adolescent users.
   - Less severe withdrawal compared to nicotine, alcohol, or opioids.
3. **Cancer Risk**:
   - Limited evidence linking chronic cannabis use to testicular cancer (non-seminoma type).
4. **Impaired Driving**:
   - Marijuana impairs reaction time, decision-making, and coordination.
   - Combined use with alcohol increases risks.

## Role in Treating Chronic Pain
- Mechanisms:
  - Anti-inflammatory effects mediated via CB2, adenosine receptors, and GPR55.
  - Evidence from trials supports THC+CBD formulations for neuropathic pain.
- CBD in **animal models** demonstrates potent anti-inflammatory action but unclear mediation.

### Pragmatic Advice for Using Cannabinoids
- Use cannabinoid extracts of consistent potency.
- Start with **CBD alone**, then gradually increase low THC:high CBD strains.
- Oral dosing is preferred once a stable dose is identified.
- Strongest recommendation: Use cannabinoids instead of opioids for neuropathic/centralized pain.
- Caution advised for individuals under 25.

## Cannabis Use in Surgery Candidates
- **Pre-Surgery Considerations**:
  - Cannabis use may affect anesthesia and pain management.
  - Smoking cannabis can cause airway swelling, complicating intubation.
  - Recommended to stop cannabis use 72 hours before surgery.
- **Post-Surgery Considerations**:
  - Chronic use may interfere with recovery and pain control.
  - Severe use linked to longer hospital stays and complications.

| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Antiemetic for chemotherapy-induced nausea    | Risk of psychotic illnesses (higher for younger users) |
| Treats anorexia, especially AIDS-related      | Cognitive impairment, such as memory loss              |
| Effective anti-spasticity agent               | Dependence (~9% of users, higher for adolescents)      |
| Anticonvulsant effects, particularly with CBD | Respiratory issues from smoking (e.g., bronchitis)     |
| Neuroprotective potential (e.g., Alzheimer‚Äôs) | Impaired driving ability and reaction times            |
| Anti-inflammatory properties reduce pain      | Potential cancer risks (e.g., testicular cancer)       |
| Promising pain relief for neuropathic pain    | Paranoia and tachycardia with overdosing               |
| Can reduce opioid dependency and overdoses    | Increased caution needed for those under age 25        |
