## **Chronic Loneliness**

### Defining Chronic Loneliness
- Loneliness is different from being alone; it can occur even when surrounded by people.
- Chronic loneliness persists and is linked to:
  - Lack of close friends and meaningful connections
  - Feeling isolated in social settings
  - Struggling with low self-worth
  - Shallow social interactions
  - Social burnout and exhaustion

### Who is at Risk?
- Groups at higher risk:
  - Immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals (due to stigma and cultural barriers)
  - Those with physical health issues or social isolation (e.g., single parents, caregivers)
  - Individuals with a history of abuse or broken family ties
  - People with chronic health or mental health conditions

### Chronic Loneliness and Health Risks
- Physical and mental health effects:
  - Inflammation, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem
  - Sleep problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, and stress
  - Increased risks of coronary heart disease (29%) and stroke (32%)
  - Greater likelihood of developing dementia in later years
  - Possible shortened lifespan

### Ways to Combat Chronic Loneliness
- **Focus on Feelings**: Recognize persistent loneliness and seek help.
- **Increase Social Connections**: Prioritize in-person interactions over social media.
- **Volunteer**: Engage in acts of kindness or join volunteer events.
- **Get Outdoors**: Spend time in nature to boost mood and reduce isolation.
