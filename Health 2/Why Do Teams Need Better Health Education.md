# The health crisis no one’s talking about: Why teens need better health education

## Introduction
- Students often only learn basic health facts, e.g., putting a condom on a banana or that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
- This scarce knowledge is insufficient for real-life health decisions.
- Only **12 percent of American adults** have proficient health literacy skills.
- This gap is evident in college, where young adults face independence and make crucial health choices.

## Personal Experience
- Witnessed widespread alcohol and drug use in the first year of college.
- Heard about sexually transmitted infections.
- Knew many friends on birth control pills without understanding the side effects.
- As a medical student, I can guide my family and friends, but not everyone has this support.

## Understanding Health Literacy
- Health literacy involves understanding health information to make informed choices.
- Addressing health literacy in high school would empower young adults to:
  - Prevent disease
  - Manage their diseases
  - Understand public health recommendations

## Impact of Health Literacy
- **41 percent** of changes in health-promoting behaviors are linked to health literacy.
- Better understanding of health leads to better decision-making.
- Improved health outcomes over a lifetime.
- Opportunity to instill lifelong habits early on with high school education.

## Current Health Literacy Levels
- Most students have an “inadequate” or “minimally adequate” level of health literacy.
- This is concerning as young adults often engage in risky behaviors and poor lifestyle choices.

## Addressing Disparities
- Poor health literacy contributes to racial and socioeconomic disparities.
- Marginalized students with strong health literacy can mitigate disadvantages.
- Opportunity to become health advocates in their communities.

## High School Curriculum
- High school students receive some education on human physiology.
- Critical topics like mental health, sexual education, and vaccines are often overlooked.
- Standardizing a health course ensures all students access vital health literacy skills.

## National Health Education Standards
- National Health Education Standards exist but are not federally mandated.
- Responsibility of students’ health knowledge left to subjective forces.
- **CDC’s Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool (HECAT)** provides evidence-based tools for curriculum planning.

- Prioritizing comprehensive health education in schools prioritizes public health.
- Empowers the next generation with knowledge and skills for healthier, more informed lives.
