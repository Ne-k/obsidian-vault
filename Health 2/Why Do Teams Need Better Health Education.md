## **Key Points**:
1. Insufficient health knowledge among adolescents is leading to poor decision-making concerning sexual and reproductive health, substance use, mental wellness, nutrition, and overall lifestyle choices.
2. Traditional school curriculums often fail to provide comprehensive and age-appropriate health education due to factors such as lack of resources, teacher training, and societal taboos.
3. The consequences include increased rates of teenage pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), mental health issues like depression and anxiety, obesity, substance abuse, and unhealthy lifestyle habits that can persist into adulthood.
4. The article suggests the need for a multi-faceted approach to improve health education:
   - Incorporating comprehensive sexual education in school curriculums from an early age.
   - Providing teacher training programs to equip educators with necessary knowledge and skills.
   - Encouraging open dialogue within families, schools, and communities about sensitive topics like sexuality, mental health, and substance use.
   - Leveraging digital platforms and social media for disseminating accurate, age-appropriate health information to teenagers.
5. The author argues that investing in better health education for teens is not just a matter of public health but also a crucial step towards promoting informed decision-making, personal growth, and future wellbeing.

# The Health Crisis no one’s Talking About: Why Teens Need Better Health Education

## Introduction
- Students often only learn basic health facts, e.g., putting a condom on a banana or that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
- This scarce knowledge is insufficient for real-life health decisions.
- Only **12 percent of American adults** have proficient health literacy skills.
- This gap is evident in college, where young adults face independence and make crucial health choices.

## Understanding Health Literacy
- Health literacy involves understanding health information to make informed choices.
- Addressing health literacy in high school would empower young adults to:
  - Prevent disease
  - Manage their diseases
  - Understand public health recommendations

## Impact of Health Literacy
- **41 percent** of changes in health-promoting behaviors are linked to health literacy.
- Better understanding of health leads to better decision-making.
- Improved health outcomes over a lifetime.
- Opportunity to instill lifelong habits early on with high school education.

## Current Health Literacy Levels
- Most students have an “inadequate” or “minimally adequate” level of health literacy.
- This is concerning as young adults often engage in risky behaviors and poor lifestyle choices.

## Addressing Disparities
- Poor health literacy contributes to racial and socioeconomic disparities.
- Marginalized students with strong health literacy can mitigate disadvantages.
- Opportunity to become health advocates in their communities.

## High School Curriculum
- High school students receive some education on human physiology.
- Critical topics like mental health, sexual education, and vaccines are often overlooked.
- Standardizing a health course ensures all students access vital health literacy skills.

## National Health Education Standards
- National Health Education Standards exist but are not federally mandated.
- Responsibility of students’ health knowledge left to subjective forces.
- **CDC’s Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool (HECAT)** provides evidence-based tools for curriculum planning.
