But if they realize that no one id different from each other besides the fact of there color then there would be harmony. It's something that can be achieved so easily if people weren't so blind-sided by the things they have heard or learned by fake news.

Dear friend, 

I appreciate your optimism in believing that racial harmony can be achieved in our country, and you're absolutely right that misinformation and ingrained prejudices learned and passed down from our elders and fake news contribute significantly towards division and recognizing these obstacles is a crucial step towards fostering  understanding. 


However, I wonder if complete racial harmony is feasible within our country, given the complex challenges we face. Deep-seated biases and systemic issues have been a part of our society for a long time, and overcoming them requires more than just awareness and hope, it demands unified, sustained effort, education, and open dialogue from all sides, and there's always people who will think opposite of you, regardless of the circumstances. While realizing that no one is fundamentally different aside from appearances is a powerful notion, implementing this understanding on a wide scale throughout the country is in fact going to be difficult. 


With that said, I believe that striving for harmony is incredibly valuable, even if the end goal seems distant. Every small step taken to challenge misinformation, promote empathy, and encourage respectful conversations bring us closer to a more unified society. 

With Regards,
